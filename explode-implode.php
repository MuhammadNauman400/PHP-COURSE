<!-- The explode() function is used to split a string into an array of substrings based on a specified delimiter.

The implode() function is used to join array elements into a single string. It takes an array and concatenates its elements, using a specified string as a separator (or "glue") between them. -->

<!-- Syntax:
$splitted = explode("\n", $text);
$merged = implode("---", $splitted);


var_dump($merged); -->
