WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF E FUNCTION


 The e() function is a helper function for escaping output before displaying it in HTML.
htmlspecialchars() converts special characters into HTML entities.
For example:

< becomes &lt;

> becomes &gt;

" becomes &quot;

' becomes &#039;

ENT_QUOTES ensures that both single (') and double (") quotes are escaped.

UTF-8 specifies the character encoding, which prevents issues with special characters.

âœ… Why use it?
This prevents Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
If someone inserts HTML/JavaScript into your database (e.g., <script>alert("Hacked!")</script>), calling e($result['title']) ensures
it will be shown as text in the browser, not executed as code.
